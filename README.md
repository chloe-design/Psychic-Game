# Psychic-Game
//This project allows users to use any alphabetic number to guess what the game is thinking. 
  The user has 9 attempts to guess what the letter is before they lose/win.
  
//Using simple html and javascript commands the user is able to see text on the screen and use their 
keyboard to guess a letter.

//To get started the user must input a letter and see if they win or lose based on what the computer is thinking
